## fen

A Clojure library for parsing [FEN notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation).

FEN is a simple, standard notation for describing a position on a chess board. It includes all the necessary information to start a game from a position, including pawn and piece placement, whose turn it is, castling rights, en passant squares, move number, and the halfmove clock used to track the [fifty-move rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifty-move_rule).
